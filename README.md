# ENBREA GUID FACTORY

This .NET Core library provides a factory class for generating deterministic GUID values. See [RFC 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) for algorithm details. This library is based on existing code from the following [blog article](https://faithlife.codes/blog/2011/04/generating_a_deterministic_guid/).

## Installation

```
dotnet add package Enbrea.GuidFactory
```

### Example

``` csharp
Guid guid = GuidFactory.Create(GuidFactory.DnsNamespace, "guid.enbrea.org");
```
